The -nsteps functionality is deprecated, and may be removed in a future version. Consider using gmx convert-tpr -nsteps or changing the appropriate .mdp file field.

Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 5000000 steps, 1e+04 ps

Changing rlist from 1.034 to 1.054 for non-bonded 8x4 atom kernels

Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 1.054 to 1.257


When checking whether update groups are usable:
  Domain decomposition is not active, so there is no need for update groups

Update task can not run on the GPU, because the following condition(s) were not satisfied:

Only the md integrator is supported.
PLUMED is not supported.

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 1 MPI process

Using GPU 8x8 nonbonded short-range kernels

Using a dual 8x8 pair-list setup updated with dynamic, rolling pruning:
  outer list: updated every 40 steps, buffer 0.257 nm, rlist 1.257 nm
  inner list: updated every  4 steps, buffer 0.021 nm, rlist 1.021 nm
At tolerance 0.005 kJ/mol/ps per atom, equivalent classical 1x1 list would be:
  outer list: updated every 40 steps, buffer 0.337 nm, rlist 1.337 nm
  inner list: updated every  4 steps, buffer 0.031 nm, rlist 1.031 nm

The average pressure is off by at most 0.00 bar due to missing LJ interactions

Using Lorentz-Berthelot Lennard-Jones combination rule
Removing pbc first time

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
